# Applying User-Centered Design to Improve User Experience of Workaround SaaS CV Builder

This is the repository for the thesis project "Applying User-Centered Design to Improve User Experience of Workaround SaaS CV Builder" completed by Vira Saliieva under the supervision of Kateryna Kamianets. 

The aim of the project is to improve efficiency, learnability, and error rate of [Workaround](https://workaround.one/), a web application that generates CVs customized to job openings.

## Artefacts

The main result of the project is the prototype of improved Workaround website. The demonstration of its final version can be found [here]().

Other key links are:

1. [FigJam Workplace]() - results of analysis, ideation, and definition stages.
2. [Figma file]() with the user flow diagrams, components, and prototypes.
3. [Demonstration]() of the first prototype version.

Other artefacts created during the research are described below.

### Analysis

During this stage, I analysed Workaround and two other resume generation websites, conducted usability testing and heuristics audit. This section includes the following deliverables:
1. Results of moderated usability testing for three websites.
2. Heuristics audit.
3. A table with calculations of time to completion for key tasks.
4. Analysis of Hotjar session recordings for Workaround.

### Definition

At this stage, I defined two personas of Workaround users and created a customer journey map for the primary persona.

### Ideation

Based on personas and initial usability research, I constructed a backlog of features and development requirements to solve the identified issues and prioritized with the help of the impact-effort matrix. This folder also contains the sketches of the interface.

### Prototyping

The most priority features from the backlog were implemented in the interactive prototype. Second prototype version also included the new user feedback collected after first round of testing.

### Testing

Two iterations of testing were conducted to validate the assumptions made in the prototypes. After this stage, I analyzed the new inputs form users and updated the impact-effort matrix accordingly.
